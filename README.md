# CareForAnimals
<p align="justify"> 
‘Care For Animals’ is a community collaboration platform to bring people together for the common goal of conserving wild animals. The platform is developed by collecting vast amounts of data about various animal species. It combines data from various sources and displays extensive information about an animal. It includes details like animal habitat, threats, their conservation status, and even the steps to prevent their extension. The platform also includes a collaborative space where people can come together and create events like cleaning drives, awareness events, or donation drives. One can also join an existing event or participate in the discussion forum. This helps in sharing ideas and inspires others to come forward to protect animals.</p>
